  - title: "Creating a GitHub Repository"
    explanation: |
      The workshop is created as a public GitHub repository.
      The commands:

      ```bash
      cd my-workshop/
      git init
      git add -A
      git commit -m "Initial workshop content"
      gh repo create USERNAME/my-workshop --public --source . --push
      ```
    examples:
      - q: "Does the repository need to be public?"
        a: "Yes — GitHub Pages for private repos requires a paid plan"
        labels: ["GitHub"]
        rel:
          - ["Public repository", "Public repo — free GitHub Pages hosting"]

      - q: "What tool creates a GitHub repo from the command line?"
        a: "gh — the GitHub CLI (gh repo create)"
        labels: ["GitHub"]
        rel:
          - ["gh", "GitHub CLI — command-line tool for GitHub"]

  - title: "Enabling GitHub Pages"
    explanation: |
      GitHub Pages serves your repository as a static website.
      You need a GitHub Actions workflow file:

      **`.github/workflows/static.yml`** automates deployment on every push to main.

      Then enable Pages in the repository settings (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions).
    examples:
      - q: "What is GitHub Actions?"
        a: "A CI/CD system by GitHub that automatically runs workflows"
        labels: ["GitHub"]
        rel:
          - ["GitHub Actions", "Automation for build, test, and deployment"]

      - q: "What happens after a push to main?"
        a: "The workflow automatically deploys all files to GitHub Pages"
        labels: ["Deployment"]
        rel:
          - ["Automatic deployment", "Every push to main triggers a new deployment"]

      - q: "What is the URL of the deployed workshop?"
        a: "https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/"
        labels: ["Deployment"]
        rel:
          - ["GitHub Pages URL", "https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/"]

  - title: "Creating the Share Link"
    explanation: |
      The share link connects your workshop with Open Learn. The format:

      ```
      https://felixboehm.github.io/open-learn/#/add?source=YOUR-WORKSHOP-URL
      ```

      When a user clicks this link:
      1. Open Learn opens
      2. A confirmation page shows what the workshop contains
      3. The user clicks "Add"
      4. The content appears on the home page alongside built-in topics
      5. The workshop is saved in the browser (localStorage)
    examples:
      - q: "How is the share link structured?"
        a: "Open Learn URL + #/add?source= + workshop URL"
        labels: ["Sharing"]
        rel:
          - ["Share link", "URL to add a workshop to Open Learn"]
          - ["?source=", "Query parameter with the workshop URL"]

      - q: "Where is the added workshop saved?"
        a: "In the browser's localStorage under the key 'contentSources'"
        labels: ["Sharing"]
        rel:
          - ["contentSources", "localStorage key for external workshop URLs"]

      - q: "Can a user remove an added workshop?"
        a: "Yes — via the ✕ button next to the topic on the home page"
        labels: ["Sharing"]
        rel:
          - ["Remove button", "✕ button to remove external content"]
