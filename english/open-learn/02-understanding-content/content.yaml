  - title: "The Three-Level Hierarchy"
    explanation: |
      Open Learn organizes content in three levels:

      ```
      Language → Topic → Lesson
      ```

      - **Language** (e.g. `english`): The interface language for explanations
      - **Topic** (e.g. `portuguese`): What is being learned
      - **Lesson** (e.g. `01-basics`): A single learning unit

      In the file system:
      ```
      english/
      └── portuguese/
          ├── lessons.yaml
          ├── 01-basics/
          │   └── content.yaml
          └── 02-verbs/
              └── content.yaml
      ```
    examples:
      - q: "What are the three levels of content organization?"
        a: "Language → Topic → Lesson"
        rel:
          - ["Language", "Top level — the interface language"]
          - ["Topic", "Middle level — the subject being taught"]
          - ["Lesson", "Bottom level — a single learning unit"]

      - q: "Which file lists all available languages?"
        a: "index.yaml — located in the root directory"
        rel:
          - ["index.yaml", "Root file listing all interface languages"]

      - q: "Which file lists the topics for a language?"
        a: "topics.yaml — located in the language folder (e.g. english/topics.yaml)"
        rel:
          - ["topics.yaml", "Topic directory per language"]

      - q: "Which file lists the lessons of a topic?"
        a: "lessons.yaml — located in the topic folder"
        rel:
          - ["lessons.yaml", "Lesson directory per topic"]

  - title: "Lesson Structure"
    explanation: |
      Each lesson is a `content.yaml` file with this structure:

      ```yaml
      version: 1
      number: 1
      title: "Lesson Title"
      description: "Brief description"
      sections:
        - title: "Section Title"
          explanation: |
            Markdown explanation text
          examples:
            - q: "Question"
              a: "Answer"
              labels: ["Category"]
              rel:
                - ["term", "translation", "context"]
      ```
    examples:
      - q: "Which top-level fields are required in a lesson?"
        a: "number, title, and sections"
        labels: ["Schema"]
        rel:
          - ["number", "Lesson number — integer, used for sorting"]
          - ["title", "Lesson title — displayed in the overview"]
          - ["sections", "Array of sections with examples"]

      - q: "What format is supported for explanation texts?"
        a: "Markdown — with bold, lists, tables, and code blocks"
        labels: ["Schema"]
        rel:
          - ["Markdown", "Text formatting in explanation fields"]

      - q: "What is the difference between q and a?"
        a: "q is the question or source text, a is the answer or translation"
        labels: ["Schema"]
        rel:
          - ["q", "Question — prompt or source content"]
          - ["a", "Answer — response or target content"]

  - title: "Labels and Related Items"
    explanation: |
      **Labels** categorize examples — by grammar, difficulty, or topic.
      They are shown as colored badges.

      **Related items (rel)** are the core of progress tracking:
      - First element = **unique ID** (used for tracking)
      - Second element = translation or explanation
      - Third element = optional context

      The same item can appear in multiple lessons. Once marked as learned,
      it counts as learned everywhere.
    examples:
      - q: "What are labels used for?"
        a: "To categorize examples — e.g. grammar concepts, difficulty level, subject area"
        labels: ["Labels"]
        rel:
          - ["Labels", "Optional tags for categorizing examples"]

      - q: "What happens when the same rel item appears in multiple lessons?"
        a: "It is treated as one learning item — learned once, learned everywhere"
        labels: ["Progress"]
        rel:
          - ["rel ID", "First element in rel array, serves as unique identifier"]

      - q: "How many elements does a rel entry have at minimum?"
        a: "Two: the term and its translation. A third element for context is optional."
        labels: ["Schema"]
        rel:
          - ["rel entry", "Array of 2-3 strings: [term, translation, context]"]
