  - title: "What is Open Learn?"
    explanation: |
      **Open Learn** is an open, static learning platform. It runs entirely in the browser
      and requires no server. Content is provided as YAML files and can be loaded from
      any source — local or from external repositories.

      **Core principles:**
      - **Open**: Anyone can create and share content
      - **Static**: No backend required, runs on GitHub Pages
      - **Flexible**: Not just languages — any topic works
    examples:
      - q: "What file format does Open Learn use for content?"
        a: "YAML — a human-readable text format"
        rel:
          - ["YAML", "Yet Another Markup Language", "File format for learning content"]

      - q: "Where can learning content be hosted?"
        a: "On GitHub Pages or any static web server"
        rel:
          - ["GitHub Pages", "Free static hosting service by GitHub"]

      - q: "Does Open Learn need a server or database?"
        a: "No, everything runs in the browser. Progress is saved in localStorage."
        rel:
          - ["localStorage", "Browser storage for settings and progress"]

  - title: "The Home Page"
    explanation: |
      On the home page, you select two things:
      1. **Interface language**: What language do you want to learn in? (e.g. English)
      2. **Topic**: What do you want to learn? (e.g. Portuguese, First Aid, Math)

      After selecting both, click **Load Lessons** to see all available lessons.
    examples:
      - q: "What do you select first on the home page?"
        a: "The interface language — the language used for explanations"
        labels: ["Navigation"]
        rel:
          - ["Interface language", "The language explanations are written in"]

      - q: "What is a 'Teaching Topic'?"
        a: "The subject you want to learn — a language or any other topic"
        labels: ["Navigation"]
        rel:
          - ["Topic", "Subject to learn", "Can be a language or any subject"]

      - q: "How do you add external workshops?"
        a: "Via a share link starting with #/add?source="
        labels: ["Content Sources"]
        rel:
          - ["Share link", "URL to add external content to Open Learn"]

  - title: "Lessons and Progress"
    explanation: |
      Each lesson consists of **sections** with **examples**. Examples have a
      question (q) and an answer (a), plus optional labels and related learning items.

      **Progress** is tracked via the related items (rel):
      - Click on an item to mark it as "learned"
      - Learned items are shown in green with a checkmark
      - Progress is saved in the browser
    examples:
      - q: "What are the parts of an example in a lesson?"
        a: "A question (q), an answer (a), optional labels, and related items (rel)"
        rel:
          - ["q", "Question — the source text or prompt"]
          - ["a", "Answer — the target text or translation"]
          - ["rel", "Related items — trackable learning terms"]

      - q: "How do you mark an item as learned?"
        a: "By clicking on the item in the lesson view"
        labels: ["Progress"]
        rel:
          - ["Learning item", "A trackable term from the rel field"]

      - q: "Where is learning progress saved?"
        a: "In the browser's localStorage — persists even after closing the browser"
        labels: ["Progress"]
        rel:
          - ["Progress", "Saved as JSON in browser localStorage"]
